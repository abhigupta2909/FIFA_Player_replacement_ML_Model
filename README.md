# FIFA Player Replacement ML Tool

This machine learning tool identifies potential replacements for soccer players based on various performance metrics and data-driven insights. By analyzing player statistics, the model suggests alternative players who could perform similarly or replace key players in specific roles or formations.

## Features

- **Player Replacement Suggestions:** The tool analyzes data and suggests potential replacements for transferred or unavailable players.
- **Customizable Model:** Supports fine-tuning for various teams, player positions, and strategies.
- **Performance Metrics:** Measures accuracy and other important performance indicators like true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR).

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The tool collects and preprocesses player statistics and match performance data, ensuring the dataset is clean and ready for model training.

2. **Model Training:**
   - The model is trained using player features and match performance data. It utilizes a machine learning algorithm such as Decision Tree Classifier to make predictions on potential player replacements.

3. **Replacement Prediction:**
   - After training, the model suggests suitable replacements for key players based on similar performance metrics and roles within a team. 

4. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - The model evaluates the accuracy of its predictions using common metrics such as:
     - **Accuracy Score:** Measures the overall effectiveness of predictions.
     - **Confusion Matrix:** Shows how well the model classifies correct and incorrect predictions.
     - **True Positive Rate (TPR):** Indicates how effectively the model predicts correct replacements (i.e., actual matches with predicted).
     - **True Negative Rate (TNR):** Reflects the model's ability to accurately reject poor replacement candidates.

## Results

The tool provides the following key outputs:
- **Accuracy Score:** The model's accuracy in predicting suitable player replacements.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visualizes the classification performance, including false positives and negatives.
- **Replacement Suggestions:** A table of suggested player replacements based on historical data.
